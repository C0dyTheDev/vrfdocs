Welcome to the **VR Framework** documentation!  
This framework is designed to give developers a solid foundation for building high-quality, immersive virtual reality experiences in Unity. Whether you’re creating a simple prototype or a large-scale VR application, the VR Framework streamlines the setup process, standardizes interaction patterns, and provides optimized components so you can focus on creating rather than reinventing core systems.

This documentation is your guide to understanding, extending, and integrating the framework into your own projects.  
You’ll find:

- **Getting Started**: Quick setup instructions to get you up and running.
- **Core Systems**: Detailed overviews of modules, interaction, and localization.
- **API Reference**: Complete technical breakdown of public classes and methods.
