The entire framework is built and designed as modular as possible. This ensures it fits as many specific needs of each project as possible. However, there are situations, where it was not possible to design a completely independent module and some dependencies are introduced. If your project has specific needs regarding these modules, please consult VRF Team. 

Currently available modules:
- [[web/Modules/Localization\|Localization]]
- Progress
- Interaction
- Minigame
