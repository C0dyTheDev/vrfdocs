This is a component useful for enabling and disabling multiple components at the same time. You can select any **Component Type** that is in the project and then assign them into the **Assigned Components** list. There are buttons that can help you with setting up this script - like **Insert All Components From Scene**, which looks for the **Component Type** through the whole scene and puts them into the list, or if you only want to pick the ones in children of the object this script is on, **Insert All Components From Children** will help you with that.
