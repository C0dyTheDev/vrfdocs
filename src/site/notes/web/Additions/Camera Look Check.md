This script checks whether the user is looking at the **Origin Object** or not. When the user looks at the object for **Time To Look** time, it invokes the **On Looking Finished Event**. **Sensitivity** is how much the object has to be in the center of the user's vision for it to count down the time. The higher the value, the more in the center the object has to be.
