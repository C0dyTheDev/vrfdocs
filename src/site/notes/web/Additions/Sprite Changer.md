**Sprite Changer** takes the object's material and changes their **Base Map** with one of the **Sprites**. You can cycle through them with **NextSprite()** and **PreviousSprite()** or you can set one directly with an index through the method **SetSpriteIndex(index)**. **Set Emission Map**, if true, sets the **Emission Map** of the material as well in addition to the **Base Map**.
