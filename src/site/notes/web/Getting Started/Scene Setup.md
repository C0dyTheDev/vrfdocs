The scene setup is currently a work-in-progress, very basic and will be completely reworked in **3.1**. Until then, it works like this: 

1. Open **VR Framework** → **Scene Setup** → **Scene Setup Wizard**
2. Click **Finish Setup**

The scene should now look something like this: 
![SceneExample.png](/img/user/img/SceneExample.png)
The scene setup will differ based on the VRF version for each stream/project.

Don't forget to setup your **additional modules** like Language Manager, Platform Manager, etc.
